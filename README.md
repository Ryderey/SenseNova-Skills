# SenseNova-Skills

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

The SenseNova model family plugs directly into agent runtimes such as [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) and [hermes-agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent), and gains stronger capabilities through skills.

In this repository each skill lives in its own directory and declares triggers, capabilities, and execution flow through a `SKILL.md` file, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) convention.

The skills cover **image generation & visualization**, **slide-deck (PPT) generation**, **Excel data analysis**, and **deep research** — usable standalone or composed into end-to-end workflows.

## What is a SKILL.md?

A `SKILL.md` is a Markdown document that teaches an AI agent how to perform a specific task. It typically contains:

- **Frontmatter metadata**: `name`, `description`, plus optional fields such as `triggers` and `metadata`
- **Instructions**: when the skill triggers, what steps to run in what order, and where the artifacts land
- **References** (optional): supporting docs, methodology notes, examples
- **Scripts** (optional): executable scripts the skill calls into

## How to Use

> These skills are designed to run inside an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/)-compatible agent — for the best experience, pair them with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) or [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for the full install + LLM configuration walkthrough.

Clone this repository, then copy subdirectories under `skills/` into the skills directory your agent loads from:

| Agent | Target directory |
|-------|------------------|
| [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) | `~/.openclaw/skills/` |
| [hermes-agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) | `~/.hermes/skills/` |

For example, copy all skills into OpenClaw:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-Skills.git
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills
cp -r SenseNova-Skills/skills/* ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

For Hermes, swap the target to `~/.hermes/skills/`.

Per-category Python dependencies, API keys, and invocation examples are documented in the 📖 Full guide for each section.

## Contributing

Feel free to use the skills here as templates for your own OpenClaw skills. The qualities that make a skill good:

- **Clear triggers**: state in `description` exactly when the skill should and should not run, so the agent recognizes it accurately
- **Focused scope**: each skill does one thing well; complex workflows compose multiple skills
- **Solid documentation**: examples, artifact contracts, edge cases, failure handling
- **Supporting resources**: use `references/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/` to provide additional context
